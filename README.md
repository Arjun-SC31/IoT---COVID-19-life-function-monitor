# IoT---COVID-19-life-function-monitor

IoT based setup that monitors the vital life function of a patient suffering from COVID-19. It monitors their pulse, breathing patterns and their temperature in real time while recording that data and tracking the patient's condition over time.

If the patient feels the need of immediate medical attention, they may press the button in place for the same purpose, which will notify the closest medical center through means of a text message sending the patient coordinates and request for immediate medical attention.

A supervised Learning algorithm will help determine whether the patient would require intensive care in the foreseeable future.

This project is a cost effective means to help monitor patient conditions in remote areas lacking proper infrastructure.
